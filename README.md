# Pokemon-deck
 
In this project, I set out to build a small web application using HTML, CSS and Javascript to load a list of the first 150 Pokémon characters from an external API (Pokémon API) and allow the user to click on a Pokémon list item to view further information/characteristics about the selected Pokémon in a modal.

This project utilises HTML, CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap, jQuery & ESLint.
